When adding a new section, it would be really useful to be able to add a heading to that section instead of adding a new one each time. This heading would normally be styled the same (eg the same background colour) so it seems nonsense to have to yet more sections, just for a heading / title.

It would look like this:


+ NEW SECTION +
[ --------- Heading / title -------]
[ --- Content ncolumns as usual -- ]

Instead of:

+ NEW SECTION +
[ --------- Heading / title -------]
+ NEW SECTION +
[ --- Content ncolumns as usual -- ]

Perhaps with the usual choice - heading for this section - H1, H2, H3, etc
